- 👀 I'm a full stack developer with 7+ years of experience on many technologies.
- 🌱 My working methodology follows most of practices from TDD and SCRUM, I'm approaching any task following and agile mindset. 
- 💞️ I usually enrich my working environment with some tools such as JIRA as workflow management system, where according to your request, I could estimate time after time issues and try to keep my effort in the estimated range.
I would say I'm really into CI/CD as well, I can write unit, integration and e2e tests on my own and if you have jenkins instance up and/or bitbucket pipelines we can execute them on the pipeline.
